Project 2:

readme 
=========
There are two folders, namely a2-1 and a2-1 corresponding to the 2 milestones for project 2. Each of these folders have their own make files which create test.out executable files in each folder. run each of them by navingating to these folders and running make and then executing ./test.out in each folder.

This test driver gives a menu-based interface to three options that allows you
to test your code:

	1. sort
	2. sort + display
	3. sort + write

Note that the driver works only with heap dbfiles created over tpch tables.
Before using the driver, make sure you have generated the necessary heap dbfiles
(you can use test driver 1 to generate the heap dbfiles. For your convenience a
copy of test driver 1 is included along with this driver. Look at files
a1-README, and a1-test.cc)

In Command promt goto folder : a2test

To compile the driver, type
	make test.out

To run the driver, type
	test.out
and follow the on-screen instructions.

Using the driver:
==================


You will be asked to enter the sort ordering that is to be passed on to the
BigQ constructor. You will need to enter the sort ordering as a CNF with only one
literal per clause. The literal must be a valid attribute name for the selected
relation. The test driver will construct a ordermaker instance to be passed on to
the BigQ constructor. Some examples are provided below. Note that to use this
feature, you need to use the new version of the files Parse.y and Comparison.cc
provided in this driver.

CNF examples to specify sort order:
===================================

dbfile      |  sortby                                  |  CNF
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
region      |  r_name 	 	                       | (r_name)
       
partsupp    |  ps_suppkey, ps_partkey 		       | (ps_suppkey) AND (ps_partkey)

lineitem    |  l_shipdate, l_extendedprice, l_quantity | (l_shipdate) AND 
							 (l_extendedprice) AND 
							 (l_quantity)

Project 2 Part 2 :
------------------

In Command promt goto folder : a2-2test

To compile the driver, type
	make test.out

To run the driver, type
	test.out
and follow the on-screen instructions.

This test driver gives a menu-based interface to three options that allows you
to test your code:


        1.  create sorted dbfile
        2.  scan a dbfile
        3.  run some query


CNF examples :

dbfile      |  sortby                                  |  CNF
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
region      |  r_name 	 	                       | (r_name)
